        <p>KFC Philippines Milestones Kentucky Fried Chicken® has come a long way since it first set foot in the Philippines in 1966— from the humble beginnings of Colonel 
		Sanders serving travellers in the back of a filling station, to selling chicken by the bucket in 1957. Today, KFC has offered some of its most delicious creations like 
		the KFC Zinger, the KFC Double Down and the KFC Chizza.

		With the rise of delicious and new food creations came the growth of the business in numbers. 
		Filipinos from all over the country craved KFC so much so that on 1999, KFC opened its 100th store in Taft PGH. 
		The brand went on to proclaim its newly designed logo in 2006 that it created a huge logo visible from space. 
		It was also in the same year where KFC opened a redesigned store in Market Market.
